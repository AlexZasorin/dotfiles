    "The pen is meant to slow you down. The words shouldn’t land on paper at the speed of thinking or even talking.\nThe writing must hurt your wrist or hand. It must turn into a burden. That pain is a signal telling you that you have written long enough. Maybe you wrote only five lines. Perhaps one thousand.\nIt doesn’t matter.\nYou take a break."
