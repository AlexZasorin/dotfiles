    "I'm the king of my own land\nFacing tempests of dust, I'll fight until the end\nCreatures of my dreams raise up and dance with me!\nNow and forever, I'm your king!"
    "Until the day when God shall deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words, Wait and hope."
    "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
    "I saw death rising from the earth, from the ground itself, in one blue field.\nA present for my friends... at Thanksgiving."
    "In case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight."
    "Hello, Elliot."
    "Joe, when you see Emily\nTell her to wait for me\nCause I still have work to do..."
    "Touch, sweet touch\nYou've given me too much to feel\nSweet touch\nYou've almost convinced me I'm real\nI need something more\nI need something more"
    "I see your star\nYou left it burning for me\nMother, I'm here"
    "Ã‰toile, et toi\nEt toi, et moi\nTu es mon univers"
    "I used to be fine because you\nAlways seemed so far away\nBut now I feel our paths getting closer each day\nIt's rather strange"
    "Correct, alchemist! You've defeated me. Take everything you want!"
    "There was no choice. There are some things no one can bear. I meddled in all the possible futures I could create until, finally, they created me."
    "There can be no reasonable doubt: the ancient mystery is solved at last. Yet, oh God, there were so many stars you could have used.\nWhat was the need to give these people to the fire, that the symbol of their passing might shine above Bethlehem?"
